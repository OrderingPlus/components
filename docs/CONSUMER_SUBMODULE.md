# Consumer submodule pin workflow

`ordering-components` is embedded as a **git submodule** at `src/@/components` in every consumer app. After this repo merges gated changes to `main`, each consumer updates its **gitlink** (the commit SHA recorded in the parent repo) in a separate PR.

**No consumer CI changes are required for ORD-1084** — apps inherit confidence because the shared repo itself runs the CI Quality Gate.

## Consumer repos

| Repo | Submodule path | Package manager |
|------|----------------|-----------------|
| [website-marketplace-v26](https://github.com/Finitless-com/website-marketplace-v26) | `src/@/components` | pnpm (parent) / yarn (submodule tests) |
| [ordering-app-marketplace-v26](https://github.com/Finitless-com/ordering-app-marketplace-v26) | `src/@/components` | yarn |
| [ordering-app-business-v26](https://github.com/Finitless-com/ordering-app-business-v26) | `src/@/components` | yarn |
| [ordering-app-driver-26](https://github.com/Finitless-com/ordering-app-driver-26) | `src/@/components` | yarn |

## When to bump

Bump the submodule SHA in a consumer when:

- You need a **feature or fix** merged to `ordering-components` `main`.
- You are aligning all apps to the same components release before a deploy.
- A security or breaking-change notice requires consumers to pick up a minimum SHA.

Do **not** bump casually on every `ordering-components` merge unless the consumer actually needs the change — pin intentionally.

## Pin to a specific commit (recommended)

From the **consumer repo root** (not inside the submodule):

```bash
# 1. Fetch latest components
git submodule update --init --recursive
cd src/@/components
git fetch origin
git checkout <COMMIT_SHA>   # e.g. abc1234 from ordering-components main after merge
cd ../../..

# 2. Record the new gitlink in the parent repo
git add src/@/components
git status   # should show: modified: src/@/components (new commits)
```

Commit in the **consumer** repo (English message):

```
chore: bump ordering-components to <COMMIT_SHA>

Picks up <short description or Linear ID, e.g. ORD-1084 CI gate>.
```

Open a PR in the consumer repo. Run that app's usual verify commands (see each repo's `CLAUDE.md`).

## Find the SHA to pin

```bash
# On ordering-components after merge to main
git log origin/main -1 --format='%H %s'

# Or from GitHub: merged PR commit on Finitless-com/ordering-components
```

## Fresh clone (developers)

```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/Finitless-com/website-marketplace-v26.git
# or, if already cloned without submodules:
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

## Editing components (contributors)

Logic changes belong in **ordering-components**, not copied into consumer `src/ui`:

1. Work in `ordering-components` (or `src/@/components` submodule checkout on branch `feature/ORD-…`).
2. PR → green **CI Quality Gate** → merge `main` → promote `production` if applicable.
3. Bump submodule SHA in each consumer that needs the change (separate PRs per app).

See [CLAUDE.md](../CLAUDE.md) for controller/UI boundaries and platform entry points.

## CI relationship

| Repo | CI on components code? |
|------|------------------------|
| `ordering-components` | **Yes** — Vitest + 70% scoped gate ([ci-coverage-plan.md](./ci-coverage-plan.md)) |
| Consumer apps | **No** (ORD-1084) — submodule is tested upstream; consumers run their own app CI only |

Future issues (ORD-1078, ORD-1079, …) add CI to each consumer's **app-owned** code (`src/ui`, `src/pages`, etc.), not to re-test the submodule.

## Checklist — consumer bump PR

- [ ] Submodule points to a commit on `ordering-components` `main` (or agreed release branch).
- [ ] That commit had green **CI Quality Gate** on the components repo.
- [ ] Consumer app builds / tests pass (`pnpm build` web, `npx tsc --noEmit` + `yarn test` RN).
- [ ] PR description notes why the bump is needed and links the components PR or Linear issue.
